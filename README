* Leanings of Spring Data JPA
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.query-methods ---> reference doc for query methods

** Student contains Gaurdian as Embedded class

** Course and CourseMaterial has one-one relationship - CourseMaterial is having foreign Key of course Id in it
   * If we tried to save CourseMaterial without having the respective course details in course table, then it will throw
    exception. Inorder to get rid of this error, CASCADING came to picture.

    * For fetching data from the tables which are having mappings ,  there are two types of fetching types.
        1. Eager - when u try to fetch data of courseMaterial if u need course details also to be fetched, then for gor eager fetching.
        2. Lazy - when u try to fetch data of courseMaterial if u DONT NEED course details  to be fetched, then for gor Lazy fetching.
            When we try to fetch Lazy course material, there will be chance of getting course as null.
            now when we try to print it it wll give error.(org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy [com.springdatajpa.springdatajpa.entity.Course#1] )
            So we have to exclude course details from to_string method of courseMaterial
** Till now we have created a course reference in course material. When we tries to print course alone we will get
only course details. If we need to get course material details as well then we have to create a bi directional
mapping from course to course material.
